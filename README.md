Title: Predicting the Market Value of English Premier League Players

Description: This project predicts the market value of EPL players based on their age, club, position etc.

As there are only a few hundreds of players in the top 20 teams of EPL, machine learning was applied using scikit learn. Two techniques were used - Lasso Regression and Random Forest Regression. It was found that while the former could tell which factors play a major role in determining the market value of players, the latter could predict the market value with much higher accuracy.
